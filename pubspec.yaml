  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/font/Poppins/
    - assets/font/Almarai/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Poppins
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/font/Poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
           weight: 400
         - asset: assets/font/Poppins/Poppins-Medium.ttf
           weight: 500
         - asset: assets/font/Poppins/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
           weight: 600
         - asset: assets/font/Poppins/Poppins-Bold.ttf
           weight: 700
     - family: Almarai
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/font/Almarai/Almarai-Regular.ttf
           weight: 400
         - asset: assets/font/Almarai/Almarai-Bold.ttf
           weight: 700
         - asset: assets/font/Almarai/Almarai-ExtraBold.ttf
           weight: 800
